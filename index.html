        <h1>Brand New Group of Architects</h1>
        <p>Architects are professionals who design and plan buildings and other physical structures. They use their creativity and technical skills to create spaces that are functional, safe, and aesthetically pleasing. Architects work on a range of projects, from residential homes to commercial buildings to public spaces. They collaborate with clients, engineers, contractors, and other professionals to bring their designs to life. Architects need to have strong communication skills, attention to detail, and a deep understanding of building codes and regulations.</p>
